To make a client component write
'use client'    -- on top of the page
whenever using hooks such as useState or useClient u have to use client component

For dynamic routes use file name inside [] and to access the params inside function({params}) and to access params.filename

Data fetching
1. serverside Rendering (use cache - no-store  to fetch for every request)
2. staticside Rendering(it fetch only once- good for content which does not changes much )
3. incremental static generation(next : revalidate : time(sec))  // it fetch after every t sec

//Installation
npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth

Since we are using Google provider in next auth we need to set up our project and get credentials from console.cloud.google.com

check above video to check how it is done

Every next js route is serverless route which is lamda function which runs when called and make connnectin with database
/api folder contains all backend related stuff such as authentication, userRoutes, prompt(create, edit, delete) routes

Authentication
in api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js   we have imported next-auth and GoogleProvider
in Next auth it takes Providers(list of providers(GoogleProvider(clientId, clientSecret))), session, signIn
in sign if new user then create one or login

we are establishing a connection to database in utils/database.js
and schema in models/..
